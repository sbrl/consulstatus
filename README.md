# consulstatus

> Public-facing consul-backed status page

A simple status page for your Consul services. Displays whether they are up or not with a simple status page. You can choose which services are displayed by specifying their names.

**DISCLAIMER:** This project is not associated with Hashicorp or the Consul project in any way. It just uses the API of your consul instance. Hashicorp do not endorse (or even know about, probably) this project. Hashicorp and Consul are trademarks of HashicorpÂ®.

## System Requirements
 - Consul instance (authentication isn't yet supported)
 - PHP 7+ enabled web server
 - [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

## Installation
Clone this git repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sbrl/consulstatus.git
```

`cd` into the repository:

```bash
cd consulstatus;
```

Install the Composer dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

Then, point your web server at the `src` directory. For example, to start a PHP development web server:

```bash
# Run this from the root of the repository
php -S [::1]:4567 -t src
```

Finally, create the settings file. Relative to the root of the repository, it should be located `data/settings.toml`. It should look like this:

```toml
title = "ExampleCloud Status Page"

[consul]
# The base URL of the Consul API
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8500"
# The list of services to show the status of

[[service_group]]
name = "A Group"

	[[service_group.services]]
	name = "dashboard"
	description = "some description text. The description field is optional."

	[[service_group.services]]
	name = "another_service"

[[service_group]]
name = "Another Group"

	[[service_group.services]]
	name = "apple"
	description = "The apple service"

	[[service_group.services]]
	name = "orange"
	description = "The orange service"
```

Then, you should be able to load `index.php` in your web browser and it should work!
